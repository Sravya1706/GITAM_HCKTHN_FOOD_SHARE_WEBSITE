Problem Statement for Hackathon Submission
India, with a population of approximately 141 crore, faces the enormous challenge of feeding its citizens daily. Despite the tireless efforts of farmers who produce vast quantities of food, a significant portion of this food goes to waste. This food wastage is a major problem in India, exacerbating hunger and leading to environmental damage as food decomposes in landfills. 

To address this pressing issue, we need an innovative system that can efficiently report surplus food to the nearest food non-profit organizations. This solution will ensure that edible leftovers are redirected to those in need rather than being wasted, thereby reducing food waste and hunger simultaneously.

"FoodShare: A Smart Solution to Minimize Food Waste and Combat Hunger in India"
